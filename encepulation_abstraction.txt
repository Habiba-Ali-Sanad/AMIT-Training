encapsulation :
using to  hides the data and It is a mediator between things that are related to each other.
Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in  (OOP). 
It describes the idea of  data and the methods that work on data within one unit. 
This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. 
To prevent accidental change, an object's variable can only be changed by an object's method. 
Those types of variables are known as private variables.

Abstraction :
is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding unnecessary information from the user.
This is one of the core concepts of  (OOP) languages. 
That enables the user to implement even more complex logic on top of the provided
abstraction without understanding or even thinking about all the hidden background.
